# Zero Sync Integration Library for Astro: Next Steps

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete the Zero Sync integration library for Astro.

## 1. Core Functionality

* **Data Fetching (Query):**
  - Implement a component or function for fetching data using Zero Sync queries.
  - Consider using `zero-svelte`'s `Query` component as inspiration.
  - Handle query construction, execution, and result provisioning.
* **Data Modification (Mutation):**
  - Create a mechanism for updating, inserting, or deleting data in Zero Sync.
  - Explore a component similar to `zero-svelte`'s `Mutation` component or dedicated functions.
* **Real-time Updates (Subscription):**
  - If real-time updates are required, implement subscriptions to Zero Sync changes.
  - Notify Astro components of updates.
* **Authentication:**
  - If applicable, handle user login, logout, and secure data access based on permissions.
* **Error Handling and Resilience:**
  - Implement robust error handling for network issues, validation failures, etc.
  - Include retry logic, clear error notifications, and recovery mechanisms.

## Detailed Suggestions and Code Examples

### 1. Core Functionality Enhancements

* **Data Fetching (Query):**  
  - Leverage Astro's built-in data fetching capabilities.
  - Example using a custom `Query` component:



## 2. Library Structure and Packaging

* **Component Organization:**
  - Organize code into logical components with well-defined responsibilities.
  - Draw inspiration from `zero-svelte`'s `Query` and `Mutation` components.
* **Exports and API:**
  - Define a clear API surface for components, functions, and configuration options.
* **Package Management:**
  - Choose a package manager (npm or pnpm) and structure the project accordingly.
  - Create a `package.json` file with library metadata and dependencies.
* **Build Process:**
  - Set up a build process using esbuild or Rollup for a distributable library.
* **TypeScript Support:**
  - If using TypeScript, ensure type declarations are generated for type checking.

## 3. Documentation and Testing

* **User Guide:**
  - Provide comprehensive documentation with setup, configuration, and usage examples.
  - Explain components, properties, and integration into Astro projects.
* **API Reference:**
  - Document all exported modules, classes, and functions.
* **Testing:**
  - Write unit and integration tests to ensure correctness and stability.

## 4. Publishing and Maintenance

* **Repository Setup:**
  - Create a public repository on GitHub or GitLab to host source code and documentation.
* **Publishing:**
  - Publish the package to npm or another package registry for installation.
* **Maintenance:**
  - Provide ongoing maintenance and support, address bug reports, and update documentation.
